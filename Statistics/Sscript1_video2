# Set the working directory

setwd("~/datasets/titanic")

# Import the training set: train
# Your working directory might vary

# train <- read.csv("~/datasets/titanic/train.csv")
# loading the CSV file, not as factors, for better text manipulation + header

# Plotting all the values of Age and Fair, you can see the central tendency here

plot(train$Age, train$Fare, xlab = 'Age', ylab = 'Fare')

# How about finding average(mean) Age?
# Mean = Sum of all Observations / Number of Observations
# Missing 177 $Age value can be replaced by mean

mean(train$Age)

# [1] 32.20421

# Measure of Central Tendency

summary(train$Age)

# Finding boxplot to have a look at outliers 

boxplot(train$Age ~ train$Pclass, xlab = "Class", ylab = "Age", col = c("red"))

# That's not actual, using inbuild mode function 

mode(train$Age)

[1] "numeric"

#using a simple method
#creates a table of all age groups

my_mode <- table(train$Age)    

# view the output of my_mode
# let's treat the age values here as names

my_mode                        

#find the most frequent value using max

names(my_mode)[my_mode == max(my_mode)]

# [1] "24"

#find out the median

median(train$Fare)

# [1] 14.4542
